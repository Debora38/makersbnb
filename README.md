# makersbnb

We would like a web application that allows users to list spaces they have available, and to hire spaces for the night.


**Headline specifications**

Any signed-up user can list a new space.<br/>
Users can list multiple spaces.<br/>
Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.<br/>
Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.<br/>
Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.<br/>
Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.<br/>
Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.<br/>

Mockups for visuals are here: https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/makersbnb/makers_bnb_images/MakersBnB_mockups.pdf
